### Project Euler ###

This is here for me to play with occasionally. It's a pretty low priority but
I enjoy it, so consider it one of my guilty pleasures. 

I'm not especially mathematically talented, so I’m sure it’s going to take awhile. If you’re going to check in for updates, just don’t make it to often, yearly maybe. 

I've already completed problems 1-14 so I'm not going to redo them here, but if I run across the code I will post it here.
